Synopsis:

  setpgid program [arg...]

Description:

  setpgid runs a program in a new session.

  This is an ersatz setpgid command for those Unixes (e.g. Mac OS X)
  that don't have one.  It's intended to work like (or enough like)
  the one from the util-linux-ng package that I can run the RabbitMQ
  test suite as of Summer 2011 on a Mac OS X dev machine.
